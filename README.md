# YoloFaster_Rcnn-Detection

This project was developed by António Pedro Silva Matos for object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN (Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks) models. The goal is to provide a unified platform to explore, test, and compare the performance of these models across diverse datasets and scenarios.

## Introduction

This repository presents an innovative platform for object detection, combining two of the most advanced models in the field: YOLO and Faster R-CNN. Developed to provide a detailed comparison between the two approaches, the project aims to help researchers and developers explore and evaluate the effectiveness of each model in diverse scenarios.

## Overview

Object detection is a crucial area of ​​computer vision, with applications in surveillance, autonomous driving, video analysis, and more. In this repository you will find:

  -> YOLO and Faster R-CNN implementations using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
  
  -> Scripts to train and evaluate both models on different datasets.
  
  -> Detailed performance comparisons, including metrics such as precision, recall, and inference time.

  -> Guides to help understand and replicate results.
  

## Functionalities
