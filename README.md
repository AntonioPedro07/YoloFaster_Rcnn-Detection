# YoloFaster_Rcnn-Detection
Repository with implementations and comparisons of two advanced object detection models: YOLO and Faster R-CNN. The goal is to provide a unified platform to explore, test, and compare the performance of these models across diverse datasets and scenarios.

## Overview
Object detection is a crucial area of ​​computer vision, with applications in surveillance, autonomous driving, video analysis, and more. In this repository you will find:

  -> YOLO and Faster R-CNN implementations using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
  
  -> Scripts to train and evaluate both models on different datasets.
  
  -> Detailed performance comparisons, including metrics such as precision, recall, and inference time.
  

## Functionalities

 -> YOLO (You Only Look Once): An object detection model known for its speed and accuracy.

 -> Faster R-CNN: A detection model that uses region proposals to improve detection accuracy.

 -> Performance Comparison: Scripts to evaluate and compare the performance of models in terms of different metrics.

 -> Datasets: Support for multiple popular datasets such as COCO, Pascal, VOC, and others.
